# About Me

Hello everyone. My name is Cagri Yoruk. I'm currently a software engineer intern at RedHat and a graduate student at Boston University studying Electrical & Computer engineering. I've met with the ChRIS team through my cloud computing course at Boston University in October 2020. My main focus was building plugins to classify brain MRI's and return a text report based on the segmentation and running these plugins on Mass Open Cloud. The project was finished in December 2020. I was interested in to continue working at ChRIS and I've expressed my interest to my project mentor. RedHat was kind enough to offer me a position to work on ChRIS. I've started working at RedHat around 6 weeks ago. Even though I'm familiar with ChRIS, there has been a lot of learning and writing techinical documentation. I'll be writing blog posts every week or two where I share my work and experiences. Hope you like it. Stay tuned :)
