title: "Interviews and Internship Presentation"
---

As you might already know from my other posts or the about me section, I'll be graduating in May 2021. Therefore, I had a pretty intense interviewing session with a bunch of companies. This interview season started in October and lasted until mid March. Since I was already satisfied with the offers I got, I decided to focus on deciding between them rather than interviews. After discussing with my mentors and manager, I had the opportunity to interview with Red Hat as well. I told my my manager that I'm interested in cloud computing. Hence, I started the interview process with the Container Tools Team.

A little bit background about the Container Tools team. If you are interested in the cloud computing topic, then you've probably heard of `Docker` which is a software for containerized applications. The Container Tools team works on Open-Source Container tools called `Podman`, `Buildah`, `Skopeo` and, `Cri-o`. All of these tools are used for container orchestration, building images, container runtime, etc... Long story short, all these tools are an open-source alternative for `Docker`. You can learn more about the tools if you're interested:

[Buildah](https://buildah.io/)

[Cri-o](https://cri-o.io/)

[Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)

The process started with an interview/meeting with the Container Tools team's manager. This was a pretty straightforward interview, she asked me about my background, my experience with containers and especially `Docker`. At the end of the interview, I've asked multiple questions about the job and working in this team. To get the feeling for the technical side, we've decided to schedule an interview with an engineer in the team. To be honest, I was a little bit nervous in this interview. There were two principal software engineers asking me technical and also behavioral questions. They also asked me questions about my preferences, for coding. Which Editor I use, do I use a keyboard, do I have multiple monitors, how do I divide my work between these monitors, etc... This was the first time I was asked these kinds of questions. I think it's a great way to close the bridge between an interviewer and the candidate. I felt much more comfortable after these questions ðŸ˜†. At the end of the interview, they told me they are going to give good feedback for the interview comitee. One day later, they scheduled another interview with the team lead and another principal engineer.
