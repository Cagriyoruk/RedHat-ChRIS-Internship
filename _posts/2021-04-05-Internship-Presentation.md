title: "Interviews and Internship Presentation"
---

As you might already know from my other posts or the about me section, I'll be graduating in May 2021. Therefore, I had a pretty intense interviewing session with a bunch of companies. This interview season started in October and lasted until mid March. Since I was already satisfied with the offers I got, I decided to focus on deciding between them rather than interviews. After discussing with my mentors and manager, I had the opportunity to interview with Red Hat as well. I told my my manager that I'm interested in cloud computing. Hence, I started the interview process with the Container Tools Team.
