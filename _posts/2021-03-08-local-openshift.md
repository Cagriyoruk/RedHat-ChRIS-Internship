title: "MOC Integration and Local Openshift"
---

After MOC routes being down for a week, I was able to start a documentation to integrate MOC with ChRIS. Personally I like to call these files living documents. Because from every experience and different problems we encounter, we update the documentation. It's a good opportunity to reflect back and see the changes that can be done. While I was working with the document, one of my mentors suggested that I should build a local openshift cluster so that whenever the MOC is down, I can continue to deploy and test services/plugins locally.

To be honest, I thought building a local openshift cluster would take a lot of time and effort. However, I found out that `Openshift 4.x` versions use a tool called CodeReady containers. which is super easy to use. You just download it and place it in your PATH. Then with couple command lines, you have access to your local Openshift Cluster. If you're interested learning more about CodeReady Containers, there's a dedicated documentation -> [CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.24/html/getting_started_guide/index)

Started the OpenShift cluster.

The server is accessible via web console at:
  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing

Log in as administrator:
  Username: kubeadmin
  Password: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Log in as user:
  Username: developer
  Password: developer

Use the 'oc' command line interface:
  $ eval $(crc oc-env)
  $ oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443

```

After getting local Openshift up and running with CodeReady Containers, I've decided to deploy our services `pfioh` and `pman` in order to test actual plugins. The deployment process was pretty straightforward. I just changed a couple of lines in the templates and the services were ready to roll. Right after I deployed the services, I tried push/pull files from Openstack with `pfioh` and run plugins using `pman`. As expected `pfioh` was working without any problems. I was able to push and pull files from Openstack.

```
(chris_env) [cyoruk@localhost ~]$ oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
Logged into "https://api.crc.testing:6443" as "developer" using existing credentials.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with ' project <projectname>':

    flask-chris
  * local-chris

Using project "local-chris".
(chris_env) [cyoruk@localhost ~]$ oc status
In project local-chris on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

I want to wrap up this blog post with saying that I finished the first draft of the MOC integration. If you want to take a look or give any feedback you can find it here -> [ChRIS MOC Integration](https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/usecases/MOC_integration/moc_integration.adoc). As always, Thanks for reading ðŸ˜ƒ
