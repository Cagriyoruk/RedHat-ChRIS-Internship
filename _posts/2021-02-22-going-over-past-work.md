If you've red my introduction, you might know that I was involved in ChRIS project for developing plugins as a student developer. I was assigned to build a plugin that classifies brain MRI's using convolutional neural networks and spits out a segmentation of the brain as a pdf text report with 4 other people. The project was called containerizing neural networks for medical compute and it was for a semester project of EC528 Cloud Computing class. If you want to learn more about the project, here is the GitHub repo for it -> [Containerizing Neural Nets](https://github.com/BU-CLOUD-F20/Containerizing_Neural_Nets). There is extensive explanation and how to replicate and use it.
