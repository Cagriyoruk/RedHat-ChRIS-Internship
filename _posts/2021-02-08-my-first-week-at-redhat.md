title: "My First Week at Red Hat"
---

I'm starting this blog halfway through my internship. So it's been a while and I may not be able to depict every experience I had or work I did. However, I will try my best :)

The long waited first day of work. I can still remember the excitement I had. I was a little bit worried since I didn't had a clue about what to expect from the first day. My mentor Mo Duffy reached out to me in the morning and we went over onboarding related tasks and set up my Red Hat account. Since I was the only intern that was hired in February, there wasn't an intern orientation session. Hence, I was given last years orientation session videos. There was lots of things I learned about the company and the culture. They also went over some technical skills that might help during the internship like Git, etc... 

I receieved my work laptop on the second day of my internship. I was given a Lenovo Thinkpad with RHEL as the operating system. My team wanted me to work with a Fedora distribution. Therefore, I installed Fedora 33 on it. I've always work with Ubuntu VM's on top of my windows, so I was excited build a linux operating system as the main OS. I can say that I'm pretty happy with it so far.

My job also includes working with Openshift platform directly. We're deploying and testing the ChRIS platform on Openshift with the Mass Open Cloud as the provider. So I installed the Openshift CLI tool in order to work with it from my terminal. If you want to learn more about the Openshift CLI tool you can find it here -> [Getting Started with the OpenShift CLI Tool](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)

I wrapped first week after finishing orientation videos and installing essential libraries to use ChRIS on the Fedora distribution. I want to finish this post with sharing my work station :)
