title: "My First Week at Red Hat"
---

I'm starting this blog halfway through my internship. So it's been a while and I may not be able to depict every experience I had or work I did. However, I will try my best :)

The long waited first day of work. I can still remember the excitement I had. I was a little bit worried since I didn't have a clue about what to expect from the first day. My mentor Mo Duffy reached out to me in the morning and we went over the onboarding related tasks and set up my Red Hat account.
