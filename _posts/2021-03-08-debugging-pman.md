title: "Local Openshift and debugging Pman"
---

After MOC routes being down for a week, I was able to start a documentation to integrate MOC with ChRIS. Personally I like to call these files living documents. Because from every experience and different problems we encounter, we update the documentation. It's a good opportunity to reflect back and see the changes that can be done. While I was working with the document, one of my mentors suggested that I should build a local openshift cluster so that whenever the MOC is down, I can continue to deploy and test services/plugins locally.





Pman which stands for process manager is one of our essential servies to run ChRIS.
